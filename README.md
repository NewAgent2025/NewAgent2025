Coding Langages I Know
HTML CSS JS PHP C++ C# Python
I Have Made Several Programs/Softwares/Sites Over The Years I Have Been Coding Sense Early To Late 2019 Starting With HTML CSS JS Which Was Being Taught In School Thanks For My Teacher I Have Found Something I Really Liked And Then C# Trying To Remake A Website That Was Taken Down
I Was Also The Worlds First Person To Make The First Image Grabber For Discord Which Worked By An EXE Maker With Options And The Image They Wanted To Be Loaded And It Would Run The EXE In The Background And End It When It Was Done And Simultaneously Loading The Image On May 3rd 2022
Then I Made The Worlds Real Working Image Grabber For Discord Which Was A PHP Code In A 000WebHost Server On May 30 2022 Which I Had A Folder With No Index.php File With A Zip File With The Normal Source Code Which I Didn't Know About Until After I Also Told A Person How It Worked Sense There Was Some Issues And Then 3 Months Later Someone Made A Video About It Which Was A Python Code Which Did The Exact Thing As My PHP Code Did And Then A Year Later I Made A 1 Click Image Grabber Just To Click On It NO URL Opening To Grab Data Which Used The Discord Science URL To Grab The Temporary "Token" Which Is And Isn't The Real Discord Token
Back In Fed 16th 2022 I Made The Real First Working YouTube Sub Bot Tool Which Used Selemium To Login Subscribe Like And So On
Then Later On I Learned How To Make My Own API's Better And Have Been Using Them Ever Sense Which Is A Lot Faster
I Am Also The Worlds First Person To Solve The SDCS By Jan Sloot That WAS A 27 Year Old Mystery Of How The Source Code Worked And How He Died I Looked Through Forms And Coded 37 Or More Program/Softwares Trying To Remake It Which Took Me 2 Years To Do Fully I Told WikiPedia And Got Banned For "Conspiracy Thories" And I Don't Blame Them Either But I Even Showed Them Were They Talked About It Themself Contradicting There Own Statement
