<h3>About Me</h3>
<h4>Please Take Note This Will Be Hard To Read Sense I Haven't Put To Much Thought Into It</h4>
Coding Langages I Know HTML CSS JS PHP C++ C# Python
I Have Made Several Programs/Softwares/Sites Over The Years
I Have Been Coding Sense Early To Late 2019 Starting With HTML
Than CSS JS Which Was Being Taught In School Thanks For My Teacher
I Have Found Something I Really Liked And Then C# Trying To Remake
A Website That Was Taken Down I Was Also The Worlds First Person To
Make The First Image Grabber For Discord Which Worked By An EXE
Maker With Options And The Image They Wanted To Be Loaded And It
Would Run The EXE In The Background And End It When It Was Done
And Simultaneously Loading The Image On May 3rd 2022 Then I Made
The Worlds Real Working Image Grabber For Discord Which Was A PHP
Code In A 000WebHost Server On May 30 2022 Which I Had A Folder With
No Index.php File With A Zip File With The Normal Source Code Which
I Didn't Know About Until After I Also Told A Person How It Worked
Sense There Was Some Issues And Then 3 Months Later Someone Made A
Video About It Which Was A Python Code Which Did The Exact Thing As
My PHP Code Did And Then A Year Later I Made A 1 Click Image Grabber
Just To Click On It NO URL Opening To Grab Data Which Used The Discord
Science URL To Grab The Temporary "Token" Which Is And Isn't The Real
Discord Token Back In Fed 16th 2022 I Made The Real First Working
YouTube Sub Bot Tool Which Used Selemium To Login Subscribe Like And
So On Then Later On I Learned How To Make My Own API's Better And Have
Been Using Them Ever Sense Which Is A Lot Faster I Am Also The Worlds First
Person To Solve The SDCS By Jan Sloot That WAS A 27 Year Old Mystery Of How
The Source Code Worked And How He Died I Looked Through Forms And Coded 37
Or More Program/Softwares Trying To Remake It Which Took Me 2 Years To Do
Fully I Told WikiPedia And Got Banned For "Conspiracy Thories" And I Don't
Blame Them Either But I Even Showed Them Were They Talked About It Themself
Contradicting There Own Statement
